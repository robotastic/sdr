 * \brief Read signal information from a given WAV file.
 *
 * \p fp File pointer to an opened, empty file.
 * \p sample_rate Stores the sample rate [S/s]
 * \p nchans      Number of channels
 * \p bytes_per_sample Bytes per sample, can either be 1 or 2 (corresponding to
 *         8 or 16 bit samples, respectively)
 * \p first_sample_pos Number of the first byte containing a sample. Use this
 *         with fseek() to jump from the end of the file to the first sample
 *         when in repeat mode.
 * \p samples_per_chan Number of samples per channel
 * \p normalize_fac The normalization factor with which you need to divide the
 *         integer values of the samples to get them within [-1;1]
 * \p normalize_shift The value by which the sample values need to be shifted
 *         after normalization (reason being, 8-bit WAV files store samples as
 *         unsigned char and 16-bit as signed short int)
 * \return True on a successful read, false if the file could not be read or is
 *         not a valid WAV file.
